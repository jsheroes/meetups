# Ask Me Anything (about JS)
### Speakers: All
### Date: 16.07.2019
### Venue: Evozon
### Description:
Hello JavaScripters,

We are proposing a new type of meetup, the idea came from our previous gatherings where sometimes the discussion would go sideways, in a good way of course, but the deviations opened up a lot of discussion threads. So it only made sense to organize a meetup where we can do just that!

In this meetup, we are all open to add any questions related to:
* JavaScript
* Web,
* where to start learning from
* etc…

Anyone is welcomed to join, especially developers that are at the beginning of the road.
Ask Me Anything meetup is a place where we can all share and ask questions.
