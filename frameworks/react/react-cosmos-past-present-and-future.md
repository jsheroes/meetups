# React Cosmos: past, present and future

### Speaker: [Ovidiu Cherecheș](https://github.com/skidding)
### Date: 28.02.2019
### Venue: Evozon
### Description:
A deep dive into React Cosmos, a dev tool for creating reusable React.js components.

We’ll begin with the origin of the Cosmos, how this project came to be and how it morphed over the years.

Then we’ll look at Cosmos’ latest features, try them out and see how they improve our UI development workflow.

Subjects include:
* how to define use cases for simple components;
* how to test components in multiple states,
* how to mock complex component inputs (from global app state to remote API responses).

Finally, we’ll peek into the future and discuss what’s next for React Cosmos.
