### Description:
In this Meetup Andrei will presented the power of server-side rendering, more exactly how to use the server middleware to create an endpoint that sends email (with the help of NodeMailer), all through Next.js/Nuxt.js, 2 frameworks over React/Vue that will help us bootstrap the project and do all the SSR magic for us.

On the agenda, we'll have a few topics that cover:
* what is SSR
* what is nodemailer
* how to start a basic next/nuxt app
* Q&A

About Andrei
I've been doing web development for almost 3 years now, and I've been very passionate about Vue.js, but fear not because in this Meetup you will be able to choose between two of the newest and coolest javascript frameworks, React and Vue.
